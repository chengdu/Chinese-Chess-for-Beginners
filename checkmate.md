As shown in the figure above, it's not only a Checkmate, but also a Killing Skill, in Chinese term, 馬(horse)後(behind)炮(Cannon), Ma Hau Paau. The black King cannot move horizontally because anywhere will be captured by the red Cannon, the only direction that it can move is forward a point, but unfortunately, that position captured by the red Horse, such situation means that Black has lost.
